                <h2>Hisory of Montana</h2>
                <p>Montana's history is rooted in the rich heritage of Native American tribes, followed by the arrival of Lewis
                and Clark and the gold rush of the 1860s, which led to statehood in 1889. Conflicts like the Battle of the
                Little Bighorn and the rise of the influential Anaconda Copper Company shaped the state's early years.
                Post-World War II, Montana transitioned from resource extraction to a service-based economy, with tourism
                surpassing mining as the second-largest industry. Despite economic fluctuations, Montanans are known for their
                strong community spirit and deep connection to the environment. Summarized from <a href="https://mt.gov/discover/brief_history.aspx" target="_blank">mt.gov/discover/brief_history</a>.</p>
